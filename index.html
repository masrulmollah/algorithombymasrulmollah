<div id="WHO INVENTED ALGORITHOM" class="tabcontent">
  <h3>WHO INVENTED ALGORITHOM</h3>
  <p>Algorithms have a long history and the word can be traced back to the 9th century. At this time the Persian scientist, astronomer and mathematician Abdullah Muhammad bin Musa al-Khwarizmi, often cited as “The father of Algebra”, was indirect responsible for the creation of the term “Algorithm”.</p>

<div id="WHAT IS ALGORITHOM" class="tabcontent">
  <h3>WHAT IS ALGORITHOM</h3>
  <p>An algorithm (pronounced AL-go-rith-um) is a procedure or formula for solving a problem, based on conducting a sequence of specified actions. A computer program can be viewed as an elaborate algorithm. In mathematics and computer science, an algorithm usually means a small procedure that solves a recurrent problem.</p>

<div id="HOW ALGORITHOM WORKS" class="tabcontent">
  <h3>HOW ALGORITHOM WORKS</h3>
  <p>An algorithm, for the non-programmers among us, is a set of instructions that take an input, A, and provide an output, B, that changes the data involved in some way. Algorithms have a wide variety of applications. In math, they can help calculate functions from points in a data set, among much more advanced things.</p>
